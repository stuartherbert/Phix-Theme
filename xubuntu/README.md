Botho Theme For Xubuntu
=======================

Sorry, Canonical ... it isn't that I think you've lost the plot with
Unity (well, actually, I do, but that isn't the point), it's simply that
Unity is a terrible experience when I run my Ubuntu desktop as a virtual
machine.

So I've made the switch to Xubuntu and the XFCE desktop, and compiled
the 'Botho' theme from sources on the 'net to make it look somewhat more
familiar.

Installation
------------

To install, copy the 'Botho' folder into $HOME/.themes.
